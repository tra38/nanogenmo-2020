An attempt to see whether you can generate text (in this case, a sourcebook for the *Legend of the Five Rings* tabletop RPG) using AI Dungeon (though I did do some editing and curating of the generated text).

This is technically a novel because I wrote ```meow_adder.rb``` to add meows to the final text so that we can make it to the 50,000 word-count limit that is necessary to define whether something is a novel or not.

```input_file.md``` merely contains 3316 words, though this may be due to me not having enough time to use AI Dungeon. However, it does demonstrate the potential for AI Dungeon to generate human-readable content (provided one )
