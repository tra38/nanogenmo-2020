## nanogenmo-2020

An attempt to see whether you can generate text (in this case, a sourcebook for the *Legend of the Five Rings* tabletop RPG) using AI Dungeon (though I did do some editing and curating of the generated text).

This is technically a novel because I wrote ```meow_adder.rb``` to add meows to the final text so that we can make it to the 50,000 word-count limit that is necessary to define whether something is a novel or not.

```input_file.md``` merely contains 3267 words, though this may be due to me not having enough time to use AI Dungeon. However, it does demonstrate the potential for AI Dungeon to generate human-readable content (though a human should be ready to "improve"  upon the final output).

### Note

The sourcebook in question is about the Kolat, a powerful secret society in Rokugan that is dedicated to overthrowing the Haneti dynasty. This organization had a lot of lore in previous editions of *Legend of the Five Rings*, but in the current edition (5th edition), there was no lore forthcoming about it. So I decided to work on this project, to learn more about this mysterious entity.

The "Scroll of Courage" is inspired by discussions in the [L5R Discord](https://discord.gg/nvVX9Wb), specifically the idea that the Kolat might not actually be an all-powerful conspiracy but just a catch-all term to refer to any anti-Rokugani organization.
